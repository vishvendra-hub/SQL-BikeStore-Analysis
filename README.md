# 🚴 BikeStore SQL Analysis Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates my SQL skills by analyzing a **Bike Store Sales Database**.  
The dataset contains information about **products, brands, categories, customers, staff, stores, and sales orders**.  

Through this project, I showcase how SQL can be used to:  
- Retrieve and filter data  
- Aggregate and calculate business metrics  
- Generate insights for retail decision-making

## 📂 Dataset Structure  
The database includes the following key tables:  

- **products** → product details (name, brand, category, price, model year)  
- **customers** → customer demographics (name, city, state, contact info)  
- **orders** → order details (order date, status, customer, store, staff)  
- **order_items** → products purchased per order (quantity, price, discount)  
- **stores** → store information (name, city, state)  
- **staffs** → employees working at each store

## 🔍 SQL Queries in This Project  
Some of the queries I worked on include:  

1. **Retrieve all customers** with their contact details.  
2. **List products** with prices greater than a given threshold.  
3. **Identify top customers** by total spending using `SUM()`.  
4. **Calculate revenue per store** with `JOINs` and `GROUP BY`.  
5. **Find the most expensive products** in each category.  
6. **Count total orders** placed by each customer.  
7. **Get staff performance** by comparing the sales they handled.  
8. **Identify most popular brands** by number of orders.  
9. **Aggregate monthly revenue trends** using order dates.  
10. **Combine multiple tables** (orders, customers, staff, stores) to create a sales performance report.  

👉 All queries are included in:  
📄 `BikeStore_SQL_Project.sql`
